<p id="describe-text">MSc. Student in the Department of <abbr title="Computer Education and Instructional Technology">CEIT</abbr> at Amasya University, Turkey.</p>
<br>
<h4>Who I am</h4>
<p class="text-justify mw-0">My name is Emre. I currently am a MSc. student in the Department of Computer Education and Instructional Technology at Amasya University, Turkey. My master thesis is focused on computational thinking. During the thesis term I try to develop the web app, which is a reliable and valid to measure high school students' computational thinking skills. Also I make scientific studies on computer science education.</p>
<p class="text-justify mw-0">I graduated from industrial vocational high school, where I studied in the branch of web programming. While I was in high school, I worked as a web developer intern. Although I started developing websites in 2007, I got my first job in 2012. In the past, I have worked on websites, android apps, and web based internal systems for some of the small software companies and clients. My main experience is in back and front ends development with using the operations of CRUD. Also I can make this happen for your business as well, don’t hesitate to get in touch.</p>
<p class="text-justify mw-0">I live in Samsun, Turkey and enjoy spending my free time reading scientific book & article and novel, hanging out with friends as an asocial, learning new things about software development, watching TV series in English as my second language, and  surfing on the internet.</p>
